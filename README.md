# Paradise-Killer-manual-APworld
Manual APWorld repository for the game Paradise Killer by Kaizen Game Works.

## Paradise Killer must-knows and other oddities
1. Blood Crystals are fair game, even if the area they are in are locked behind a sphere limiter of some kind.
2. The initial talks with **Lydia**, **Judge**, and **Shinji** in the **Idle Lands** are considered freebies for the sake of any yaml options logic. As requiring 'progressive relationships' or 'Demon Translator' in addition to 'Starlight Upgrade - Goat' would negate the whole idea of them being in place to change the inherent archipelago logic.
3. Every progressive item ingame, that being an item that is required for another item ingame, requires the equivalent item being gifted through the archipelago first. It does not appear as 'in logic' until that happens.

## Paradise Killer honour system and advice
1. As Shinji would say... shit happens. If you accidentally collect an item in-game, while you are not allowed yet through the archipelago. Just write it down on a notepad so you don't forget about it.
2. Manual Archipelago's are inherently logical, and as such there is no possibility of going 'out of logic' in this apworld. Even if you could really, really make it to that ledge without dash.

### Traps
There is currently just one type of trap in place:

## Sphere limiters
Due to the enormous sphere 1-3 this game has, I have implemented optional (but highly recommended) sphere limiting options:
- **Soda License**: allows you to access the Nebula vending machines.
- **Alcohol License**: allows you to access the Whisky bottles.
- **Shinji Locations**: allows you to talk to Shinji for checks.
- **Mapping Requirements**: every region of the map (mostly as defined as the regions in-game map) has a lock of some kind that requires a key item to unlock. This locks everything except the Footbaths & NPC's to the key item of the region they inhibit. (**Highly recommended**)
- **Progressive relationships**: (it currently has 3 progressive relationships in place, but this is not correct for all different NPC's, not properly implemented yet)



## Guides 
### Installation guide
1. Go to the [release page](https://github.com/Chloe-Bt/Paradise-Killer-manual-APworld/releases) and download the latest .apworld file.
2. In the archipelago client select the click **Install APworld** section and select the downloaded .apworld file.
3. Restart the archipelago client.

(I highly recommend following step 1-3 for the '[Universal Tracker](https://github.com/FarisTheAncient/Archipelago/releases)' apworld, as it allows for highlighting which checks are currently considered to be in logic.)

### Joining a multiworld
1. In the archipelago client click the **Manual Client** section.
2. Log in using ip, port, (password) & slot name as usual.
3. In the 4th tab of the client 'Manual' you can now click the location that are in-logic.
